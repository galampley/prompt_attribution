Transformers are a type of neural network architecture that have revolutionized natural language processing and other fields by enabling models to understand context and relationships in data. They use mechanisms called "attention" to weigh the importance of different parts of the input data, allowing for more nuanced understanding compared to traditional models.

### Key Components of Transformer Models

- **Attention Mechanism**: This is the core of the transformer, allowing the model to focus on relevant parts of the input sequence. The most common type is "self-attention," which helps the model understand the context of each word in a sentence relative to others.
  
- **Encoder-Decoder Structure**: Transformers typically consist of an encoder to process input data and a decoder to generate output. Each is made up of layers that include attention mechanisms and feed-forward neural networks.

### Python Code Example

Here's a simple example of how you might define a basic transformer layer using PyTorch:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn

class SimpleTransformerLayer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, embed_size, heads, dropout, forward_expansion):
        super(SimpleTransformerLayer, self).__init__()
        self.attention = nn.MultiheadAttention(embed_dim=embed_size, num_heads=heads)
        self.norm1 = nn.LayerNorm(embed_size)
        self.norm2 = nn.LayerNorm(embed_size)
        self.feed_forward = nn.Sequential(
            nn.Linear(embed_size, forward_expansion * embed_size),
            nn.ReLU(),
            nn.Linear(forward_expansion * embed_size, embed_size)
        )
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(dropout)

    def forward(self, value, key, query):
        attention = self.attention(query, key, value)[0]
        x = self.dropout(self.norm1(attention + query))
        forward = self.feed_forward(x)
        out = self.dropout(self.norm2(forward + x))
        return out
```

### Applications

Transformers are widely used in applications like language translation and text summarization. They excel in tasks requiring understanding of context and sequence, such as generating coherent and contextually relevant text.

How might the attention mechanism in transformers inspire new ways to approach problems in other domains, such as computer vision or audio processing?
