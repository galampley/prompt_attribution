## Executive Summary

The global electric vehicle (EV) market is poised for significant growth, driven by technological advancements, regulatory support, and shifting consumer preferences. As of 2023, the market is valued at approximately $250 billion, with China, Europe, and North America leading in adoption. The market is projected to grow at a CAGR of 20% from 2023 to 2030, reaching over $1 trillion. Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) are expected to dominate, with Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) playing a transitional role. Key challenges include battery technology evolution, charging infrastructure, and supply chain constraints. Regulatory environments are favorable, with incentives and emissions regulations accelerating the shift. For a traditional ICE manufacturer, strategic entry into the EV market should focus on leveraging existing manufacturing capabilities and brand recognition. A phased approach, starting with partnerships and targeting high-growth segments like SUVs and commercial vehicles, is recommended. Financial projections indicate a need for substantial capital investment, with profitability expected within 5-7 years. The board should track metrics such as market share, R&D progress, and regulatory changes to ensure successful transition.
