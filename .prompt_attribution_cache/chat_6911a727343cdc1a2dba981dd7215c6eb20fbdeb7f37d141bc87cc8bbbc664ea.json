- **Competitive Threats (High Impact):** Intense competition from established tech giants and emerging startups could erode market share and pressure pricing strategies.
- **Regulatory Challenges (Medium Impact):** Increasing global data privacy regulations may require significant compliance investments and could limit operational flexibility.
- **Supply Chain Vulnerabilities (Medium Impact):** Dependence on a limited number of suppliers for critical hardware components poses risks of disruption and cost volatility.
- **Technological Obsolescence (Low Impact):** Rapid technological advancements necessitate continuous innovation to maintain competitive advantage.

Investors may be underestimating the impact of regulatory challenges. As global data privacy laws become more stringent, the costs and complexities of compliance could significantly affect operational efficiency and profitability, especially as the company expands into new international markets.
