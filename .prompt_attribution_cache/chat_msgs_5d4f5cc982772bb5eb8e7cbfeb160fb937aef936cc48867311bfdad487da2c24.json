    "1": {
        "rewrite": "4. Top 9 products by revenue",
        "explanation": "The original prompt specified 'Top 10 products by revenue,' which led to the model generating code that identifies the top 10 products. By changing this to 'Top 9 products by revenue,' the model will be guided to generate code that correctly identifies the top 9 products, aligning with the user's requirement."
    },
    "2": {
        "rewrite": "def top_9_products_by_revenue(df):",
        "explanation": "Renaming the function to 'top_9_products_by_revenue' will help ensure that the function's purpose is clear and consistent with the revised prompt. This change will guide the model to focus on identifying the top 9 products, reducing the likelihood of generating code that identifies the top 10 products instead."
