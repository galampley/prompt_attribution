Customer retention rate by cohort (heatmap)\n3. Average order value trend over time (line chart)\n4. Top 9 products by revenue\n5. Identification of customers at risk of churn",
        "explanation": "This rewrite directly changes the metric from 'Top 10 products by revenue' to 'Top 9 products by revenue' in the original prompt segment. According to the Influence matrix, segment 1 (which contains the metrics list) has a strong influence (0.3156) on the problematic sentence, which is the function that outputs the top products by revenue. The User comment specifically requests the top 9 products, not 10. By making this change, the LLM will be more likely to generate code that selects the top 9 products, thus resolving the user's issue."

Customer retention rate by cohort (heatmap)\n3. Average order value trend over time (line chart)\n4. Top N products by revenue, where N=9\n5. Identification of customers at risk of churn",
        "explanation": "This rewrite makes the requirement even more explicit by stating 'Top N products by revenue, where N=9'. This reduces ambiguity and ensures the LLM understands the exact number of products to select. The Influence matrix shows that the metrics list (segment 1) strongly affects the relevant output, and the User comment clarifies the desired change. This approach further minimizes the risk of the LLM defaulting to 10, as is common in such tasks."
