        "explanation": "This rewrite directly addresses the User comment, which specifies a need for the top 9 products by revenue instead of the top 10. The function name, docstring, and logic are all updated to reflect this change. According to the Influence matrix, the relevant segment (prompting for top products by revenue) has a strong influence on the corresponding code sentence, so this targeted rewrite ensures the output matches the user's intent and avoids confusion."

        "explanation": "This rewrite generalizes the function to accept a parameter n, defaulting to 9, which satisfies the User comment for top 9 products but also allows flexibility for future changes. The Influence matrix shows the original prompt segment strongly affects this code, so making the function parameterized improves usability while still aligning with the user's specific request."
