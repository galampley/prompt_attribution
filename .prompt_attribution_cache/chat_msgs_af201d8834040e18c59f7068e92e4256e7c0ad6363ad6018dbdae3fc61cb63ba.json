        "rewrite": "Be creative, but keep the explanation straightforward and not too whimsical. Include a light joke if it fits, and mention Schrödinger if relevant, but keep it brief.",
        "explanation": "This rewrite directly addresses the user comment about the output being 'a bit too weird' (e.g., 'cosmic dance partners'). By specifying 'not too whimsical' and 'straightforward,' it guides the LLM to avoid overly fanciful analogies. The influence matrix shows that this segment (segment 1) has a strong influence on the problematic sentence (sentence 1), so clarifying the tone here should reduce the likelihood of odd metaphors while still allowing for some creativity and humor."

    "2": {
        "rewrite": "Be creative, but avoid unusual or overly imaginative analogies. You can include a simple joke if appropriate, and briefly mention Schrödinger if it makes sense.",
        "explanation": "This version further clarifies that analogies should not be 'unusual or overly imaginative,' directly targeting the issue raised in the user comment. The influence matrix confirms that segment 1 is highly influential on the problematic sentence, so making the instruction more explicit about the type of creativity allowed will help the LLM generate more grounded, less 'weird' explanations."
